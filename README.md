# Play-Audio-ASL3-Node
Play an audio file over the air
### Play and Audio File locally over the air Whenever you want ###

1. First navigate to the folder where you store your sccript files, for me it's this one.
```
cd /etc/asterisk/local
```
2. Then we can down load the sceript file that plays the audio file through the asterisk server
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KD5FMU/Play-Audio-ASL3-Node/refs/heads/main/playaudio.sh
```
3. Then we need to make it executable
```
sudo chmod +x playaudio.sh
```
Then we need to know where you are storing your audio files...
